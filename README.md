# AnalysisAnnotations

## What is AnalysisAnnotations?

AnalysisAnnotations is a small .NET tool that creates GitHub pull request annotations based on code analysis reports.

This project is a work in progress with no release currently available.

In the meantime, have a look at https://github.com/laedit/vika which provides a broader set of .NET analysis report parsing functionality for both GitHub and other CI services.
